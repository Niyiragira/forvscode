        <h5 style="font-size:19.5px">Africa Can Become the World’s Super Power</h5>
        <p style="font-size:19.5px";>Africa is a resources rich continent, good climate, largest number of youth and strategic location. This implies that all these resources can be used to develop the industrial sector and yield more production. This paper will focus on how Africa can use its labor force, political elites, agriculture and many others to lead the world a better future.
            Agriculture is a major sector which yields income to a big number of Africans, this implies that it needs to be developed by qualified professionals including innovative leaders. For proper agriculture, well-structured soil is needed to influence high yields of production. Subjected to agriculture, soil should be conserved based on the factors which influences its formation. These are soil materials, climate, topography, organisms and time. The statistics show that the population of Africa is going on increasing but as we know the area of Africa is not increasing. That is why Fertilizers and other agricultural techniques are needed for the population of Africa to be capable of feeding itself and even feed some other population in the region.             
            As says the book African futures, the ongoing development process itself is reinforcing old challenges, including conflict over the wealth that commodity production generates, and it is giving rise to new challenges, including those associated with rapidly expanding urban slums. Yet domestic, regional, Pan-African and global forces are all at work to see the continent through its sociopolitical transitions. There is good reason to be cautiously optimistic that this critical element of the development process will mostly continue to change positively
            If African leaders stopped embezzlement of funds Africa can become the world’s superpower. Most corrupt leaders in Africa keep their ill-gotten wealth in international banks outside their countries. They also use funds embezzled from the public to buy properties in these countries. It is a common practice for top government officials in government to own Swiss accounts in Switzerland and buy houses in states in America, Dubai, London, and Paris among other regions. The former president Abacha of Nigeria is a good example. At his death his account in Switzerland was revealed and the country was able to retrieve some of the money he staked away. Why must it be until their deaths before such accounts can be revealed? How many more Africa leaders have such accounts?
            Mobutu Sese Seko sold the entire mineral rights of the Congo to Western (mostly American and French) corporations. Mobutu’s 4 billion dollars of Zairean loot was staked away in Swiss bank, Swiss banks only accounted for less than $10,000 at his death. Abacha stashed more than that amount in Swiss banks of which not more than 150 million has been negotiated for return to Nigeria.
            One author said that “all over the world, leadership is the most important number one factor that determines whether a nation can develop”. Poverty is worsening in many populations particularly in Africa. Corrupt activities contribute significantly to the perpetuation of poverty and to the continued underdevelopment of many countries. In a society where corruption is a daily normal occurrence; the citizens suffers because human security is denied. Corruption in office involves the negative use of power for personal gain. From the paper, it can be concluded that corruption in leadership affects development. The mismanagement of power, administrative abuse of office through bureaucratic procedures and the mismanagement of natural resources are evidence of corrupt practices in government. If this was corrected, Africa can surely become the world’s super power.
